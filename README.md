We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org)
campaign from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to
understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS
projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[send mail to gitproj@f-hauri.ch](mailto://gitproj@f-hauri.ch) for any comment
or contributions without using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
